# Linked lists

Linear collection of elements. Each element points to next element in memory

- itens can be placed anywhere in the memory
- they don't have to be consecutive
- they have a dinamic size
- the elements of a linked list don't need to have the same type
- the insertions and delete in a linked list is faster them in a array

the complexity of inserting an element in a linked list is = O(1)

the complexity of deleting an element in a linked list is = O(1)

the complexity of traversing a linked list is = O(n)

the complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is = O(n)


to use Linked List in python you need to
```py
from collections import deque
```
